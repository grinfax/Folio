    <p>I tore my meniscus and had to get surgery.<br>
        <br>
        Believe it or not, I actually walked around for the better half of a
        <strong>year</strong> not knowing what was wrong but in extreme pain.
        <strong>Three</strong> doctors, <strong>two</strong> x-rays, and
        <strong>one</strong> MRI later I found out I had a tear in meniscus
        and that was the cause of my knee pain.</p>

    <p>In my dreams I am a professional hip hop dancer and world class boxing champ.<br>
    <br>
        For the past <strong>three</strong> years I have been having this <strong>reoccurring dream</strong>
        where I am a professional hip hop <strong>dancer</strong> and world class <strong>
            boxing champ.</strong> This is probably a projection since I enjoy taking dance classes
        in my free time and would like to learn how to box.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Fun Fact 3</h1>
    <p>I met Jerry Springer and Fetty Whop. <br>
    <br>
        I know what you are thinking, pics or it didn't happen.
        Unfortunately I do not have pictures verifying these events but I have my
        <strong>memories</strong> and that's what really counts!</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Fun Fact 4</h1>
    <p>I use to love public speaking, then it terrified me; and now I love it again.<br>
    <br>
        As a child, I enjoyed being in the <strong>spotlight</strong> and speaking to large
        groups of people. I was active in <strong>student council</strong> and the
        head of my <strong>Toastmasters International</strong> group. Something changed
        in my teenage years to where I could not even stand in front of a crowd of people with out
        <strong>shaky hands</strong> and <strong>shortness of breath</strong>.
        Thankfully I have since gotten my groove back and accept any opportunity to practice my
        speaking skills.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Fun Fact 5</h1>
    <p>I only binge watch Netflix shows with female protagonists.<br>
    <br>
        Not that I discriminate against shows with male protagonist, but there is
        something very alluring about a <strong>strong, independent women forging her own
            path.</strong> It keeps me motivated.</p>
