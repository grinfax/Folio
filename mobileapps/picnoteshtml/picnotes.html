        <p class="special">As a first time apartment owner I started using my kitchen a lot more than I
            had previously at my parent’s house.</p>
        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>Using my kitchen more meant I was teaching myself to cook in a largely trial
            and error manner. Learning how to cook showed me that there were numerous ingredients needed per
            recipe I wanted to make.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't it be convenient to have some type of a mobile repository with all the ingredients
            that you have ever used? That way you wouldn't leave out ingredients when shopping for recipes
            and you could reference it when meal planning.</p>

        <p class="special">This was the idea behind my application.</p>
        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>I began by looking at cookbooks and recipe apps for inspiration. A common theme across these
            sources were the vivid use of pictures. Being a visual person pictures stand out to me.
            I decided to take this idea and run with it.

        <p>In my PicNotes application I implemented a UITableView using the language Swift.
            A UITableView is a collection of a rows, also known as UITableViewCells,
            manipulated by a TableView controller.</p>

        <p>I comprised each cell with an image icon and a text label. </p>

        <p>Aside from the UITableView implementation, adding and hooking up the edit and add new
            buttons, and registering an active text Field that syncs with the add new button; the
            major algorithm behind my application was matching the user’s input to the appropriate
            icon in the database. </p>

        <p>My image icons are .PNG files that I imported into my application’s database.
            A default icon is included in the database as well, in case no icon is found.</p>

        <p>On the first go around, my function was full of various if-statements checking
            each individual condition that could be encountered. 50 plus lines later my
            function worked, but was running inefficiently. Taking a step back to rethink my
            logic, on my second go around I was able to cut my 50 plus line function into a
            20 line function that ran in a more efficient and straightforward manner.</p>

        <p class="special">My app was now complete. Success!</p>
        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>However, after a week of having my app on my mobile device I found that I was using
            the standard notes app to make my grocery lists instead of using the app I spent
            weeks making.</p>

        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>
        <p class="special">Something needed to change. </p>
        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>My app needed an edge or a differentiating quality over the standard notes app.</p>

        <p>I spend days racking my brain for ideas, then it dawned on me.
            The code in my application was sound, but the idea behind why my
            application was needed had to be reworked. </p>

        <div class="buffer"></div>
        <div class="buffer"></div>

        <p>I realized that allowing users to add recipe ingredients/grocery items was extremely limiting.
            Why not have my application mimic the notes application in the sense of allowing the user
            to add any content imaginable, and support the added functionality of pictures.</p>

        <p class="special">When using my application, not only can you add grocery store items,
            but you can also add tasks that need to be completed.</p>
        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>Now for the fun part, supporting the added functionality of pictures.</p>

        <p>Having the ability to add icons to my applications database gives my application a
            personalized feeling. For example, “exercise for 1 hour” was a recurring task in my application.
            Because of this I found an exercise icon and added it to my applications database.
            During one week where I had an extensive group project, I added a study group icon that
            appeared every time I added “study group” to my task list.

        <div class="buffer"></div>

        <p class="special">Rethinking the way my app was used increased its value significantly.</p>

        <p>Now I vist my app on a daily basis to view and update my everyday tasks.</p>

        <p>In the future I plan to add a camera view capability. This way if the default icon
            appears next to a task a user can tap on the icon to open up their iPhones camera
            and replace the icon with their own pictures.</p>

        <p>Another feature to add are push notifications. Because my application holds tasks
            that users need to complete in timely manners getting notifications to view those
            tasks would increase user productivity. </p>
