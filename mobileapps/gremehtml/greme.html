        <p class="special">Using GRE Prep books means answering practice questions with tons of tricky vocabulary.</p>

        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>Since there was a correlation in this and the questions I was getting wrong I
            decided to write them all down. A week in my list was getting large with
            about 47 different terms. Make some flashcards you say? Tried that.</p>

        <p>Sure, I could be one of those people who carry around those extra large flashcards but,
            not only was it time consuming to keep up; If we are being honest I really never wanted
            to pull out that hunky deck of flashcards. I wasn't studying them.</p>

        <p>There had to be a better way. I needed an approach that would be more effective.
            Then the idea came to me. Being in the age of technology, I decided to make a
            mobile app to quiz myself over those vocabulary words.</p>

        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>
        <p class="special">Now I have a virtual copy of my vocabulary words that is accessible to me at anytime.</p>

        <p class="special">This application was programed in Xcode using Swift.</p>
        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>Initially, I wanted to mimic the “flipping” behavior that flash cards have. I made front and
            back images representing the vocabulary term and definition respectively.</p>

        <div class="buffer"></div>
        <div class="buffer"></div>

        <video loop="true" controls autoplay><source src="mov1.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
        <p class="specialTwo">Video of the "flipping" behavior</p>

        <div class="buffer"></div>
        <div class="buffer"></div>

        <p>With this approach sub decks are created holding cards that the user specifies they
            know or they don't know. Once the user has flipped all of the cards in the deck
            they are given the option to play again but using either the deck they said they
            knew or using the deck they said they didn't know.</p>

        <p>This method worked like a charm, however the experience was not ideal.
            Creating two separate images for my vocabulary words was not better than writing
            out my extra large flashcards, it was worse! Once an image was made it could not
            be edit, even for spelling errors. Even more importantly than that, It was hard
            to gauge if the user was comprehending or flipping through the images of the
            cards. </p>

        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p class="special">With no way to check the user's understanding my application failed
            the effectively test.</p>

            <img class="large" src="nBack.png">
            <img class="large" src="nFront.png">
            <p class="specialTwo">Images of a cards front side and back side</p>
            <div class="buffer"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="buffer"></div>
        <div class="buffer"></div>

        <p class="special">I knew I could make my application better so I did.</p>

        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p> Version 2 of my application focused more on data structures. What data structure
            would allow me to assess and manipulate my data in the best way?</p>

        <p> I decided to use a dictionary with vocabulary term keys and term definition pairs.
            Now I have the ability to edit and modify my vocabulary words. The taxing job of
            adding terms to my list is now an easy job. With program modifications came user
            interface modifications. </p>

        <p>Keeping track of the user's score in real-time was
            important to me. To do this I added a progress style bar at the bottom of the
            application. In the progress bar the user can find the number of terms in the
            list, and their count of correct and incorrect vocabulary term guesses.
            A results page pops up at the end of the quiz displaying the user score as
            a numeric value plus other information.</p>

        <div class="smallBuffer"></div>

        <p>Until then I will use my daily interactions to testing my product.
            Discovering what I like, and revising what I don't like. This way I
            will hone in on making a cohesive, user friendly quiz application.</p>
