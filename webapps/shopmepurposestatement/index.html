                ability to compare prices of multiple items from different websites ensuring <br>
                you are getting the best deal and plan purchases according to other purchases,<br>
                for example making sure the chair you want to buy is a good fit with the desk <br>
                you also want to buy or that the top from Macy's matches the pants from Levi's. <br>
